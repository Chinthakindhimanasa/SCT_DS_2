# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of **SkillCraft Technology Internship - Task 02**.  
The objective is to perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a dataset from Kaggle.  
I have chosen the **Titanic Dataset**, which is widely used for learning data science and machine learning concepts.  

The analysis includes:  
- Handling missing values  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploring relationships between variables  
- Identifying key patterns and trends  
- Visualizing insights using graphs

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset is available on Kaggle:  
🔗 [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)  

The Titanic dataset provides information about passengers such as:  
- Passenger ID  
- Name  
- Age  
- Gender  
- Ticket Class (Pclass)  
- Fare  
- Cabin  
- Embarked Port  
- Survival (Target variable)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Steps Performed  
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**  
   - Load the dataset using Pandas  
   - Understand the dataset shape and features  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values (`Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`)  
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical form  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Survival rate analysis based on gender, age, and class  
   - Correlation between features  
   - Distribution of numerical features  

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Bar plots, histograms, and pie charts  
   - Heatmaps for correlation  
   - Box plots for outlier detection

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate compared to males.  
- Passengers in **1st class** survived more than those in 2nd and 3rd class.  
- Younger passengers (children) had a higher chance of survival.  
- Fare price and survival showed a positive correlation.

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to perform data cleaning, EDA, and visualization on a real-world dataset.
The insights gained can help build predictive models (like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) in further tasks.
